### 🚀 Making Civic Issue Reporting Intelligent

Report • Detect • Classify • Prioritize • Resolve

</div>

---

## 🌟 Overview

CivicSense is an AI-powered civic intelligence platform that enables citizens to report infrastructure issues using photographs while automatically identifying, classifying, prioritizing, and routing complaints using computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Instead of manually reviewing thousands of complaints, CivicSense performs intelligent analysis on uploaded images and produces structured issue reports that help municipalities respond faster.

The platform bridges the communication gap between citizens and local authorities by combining:

- 🤖 AI Vision
- 📍 Smart Location Detection
- 🗺 Interactive Mapping
- 👥 Community Verification
- 📊 Administrative Analytics
- ⚡ Real-Time Tracking

---

# 🎯 Why CivicSense?

Cities receive thousands of complaints every month.

Many of them suffer from:

- Duplicate reports
- Missing information
- Incorrect categorization
- Slow response time
- Lack of transparency
- Poor prioritization
- Manual verification

CivicSense automates this entire workflow using AI.

---

# 💡 The Solution

CivicSense allows any citizen to simply:

📸 Take a Photo

↓

📍 Detect Location

↓

🤖 AI Classifies Issue

↓

🚦 Assign Severity

↓

🏢 Route to Authority

↓

📊 Track Progress

↓

✅ Resolution

The result is a smarter, faster, and more transparent civic issue management system.

# 🧠 AI Classification Engine

CivicSense uses **Groq Vision AI** powered by the **Meta Llama 4 Scout** model to intelligently analyze uploaded images.

### AI automatically determines

- Civic Issue Category
- Severity Level
- Human-readable Description
- Confidence Score
- Whether the image actually contains a civic issue

---

## Supported Categories

| Category | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| 🛣 Potholes | Broken roads, cracks |
| 🗑 Garbage | Waste accumulation |
| 💧 Water Leakage | Pipe leaks, sewage |
| 🚦 Traffic Signal | Broken traffic lights |
| 💡 Streetlights | Faulty street lights |
| 🌧 Drainage | Flooding, clogged drains |
| 🚗 Illegal Parking | Unauthorized parking |
| 🏗 Encroachment | Illegal construction |
| 🌫 Air Pollution | Smoke, dust |
| 🔊 Noise Pollution | Loud public disturbances |
| 📦 Others | Miscellaneous civic issues |

---

# 📊 Severity Classification

AI predicts one of four severity levels.

| Level | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 🟢 Low | Minor inconvenience |
| 🟡 Medium | Needs attention |
| 🟠 High | Significant public impact |
| 🔴 Critical | Immediate action required |

Severity is calculated using:

- Image contents
- Issue category
- Community verification
- Time since reporting
- Location importance
